# MongoDBWebappTEST

CRUD Application with MongoDB 


In this project I tried to use Spring4 benefits so I made all configurations with java classes

I created a Entity Person and I gave id,name,lastName fields for that object .
I created unique id and I used it to reach the person which we need . 
After I created an DAO and Service layer and this service do CRUD operations ,
I reached from controller and servlet classes named with PersonController.class ve AddPersonServlet.class ,

in view side my Index.jsp called ListUser.jsp file which is under WEB-INF/views/ListUser.jsp which is defined 
in configurations .

After I finished to design ListUser.jsp about javascript codes (I also used jquery library )
I passed to unit,functional and integration tests I wrote very simly test cases 

(if we want to run test classes enable AbstractMongoDbTest becuase Maven try to run this class)

Have a nice day
